ApprovalSalesOrder
A simple Java program to group sales orders by their approvers. Each sales order has a unique ID and is assigned to one or more approvers. The program processes a list of sales orders and outputs the approvers and the associated sales orders they are responsible for.

Features
Groups sales orders by approvers.
Handles multiple sales orders assigned to the same approver.
Outputs a clear mapping of approvers to sales orders.
How It Works
Input: The program accepts a list of SalesOrder objects, each containing:

A unique sales order ID (orderId).
A list of approvers (approvers).
Processing:

Groups sales orders by approvers using a Map<String, List<String>>, where:
The key is the approver ID.
The value is a list of sales order IDs.
Output:

Displays the mapping of approvers to their associated sales orders.

        for (String approver : order.getApprovers()) {
            approvalMap
                    .computeIfAbsent(approver, k -> new ArrayList<>())
                    .add(order.getOrderId());
